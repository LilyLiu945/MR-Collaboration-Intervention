## Overview

Mixed Reality (MR) environments enable users to collaborate through speech, movement, and shared attention.
However, when these behaviors become unbalanced—such as one member dominating or others disengaging—overall collaboration efficiency decreases.

This project investigates whether behavioral cues in MR can predict when system-guided interventions should occur to improve teamwork efficiency.

We aim to build interpretable, data-driven models that:

* Detect early signs of imbalance or poor coordination

* Predict upcoming low-efficiency collaboration periods

* Suggest optimal timing for system interventions

Applications include education, remote collaboration, and team training in MR.
