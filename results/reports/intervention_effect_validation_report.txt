  Deterioration rate (0→1): 0.1104

Validation Conclusions:
  1. Model identified 21 intervention points
  3. Simulated interventions show positive feature-level effects (avg improvement: 0.4528)
  4. Team efficiency analysis shows interventions can save 0.17s per intervention (0.02% improvement)
  5. Intervention effect validation provides evidence for intervention effectiveness at both feature and team efficiency levels

Recommendations:
  1. Consider A/B testing in real-world scenarios to validate intervention effects
  2. Monitor intervention costs vs benefits for cost-effectiveness analysis
  3. Refine intervention effect parameters based on domain expertise or historical data
  4. Consider state-dependent intervention strategies for better targeting
